# Open punch-list — things raised in conversation (living doc)

Purpose: we keep losing items to context compaction. This is the durable list of
what Eric asked for that is **outstanding or needs Eric**. Updated 2026-07-14.
Legend: ⏳ open · ✅ done this stretch · 🔑 needs Eric (key/secret) · 🚀 needs Eric's `git push` · ❓ needs Eric to clarify.

---

## Needs Eric (do these "all at once")

- ✅ **Stock photos** — DONE 2026-07-14. `PEXELS_API_KEY` set on prod + redeployed (the
  key was in an image Eric pasted, which a text search of the transcript missed). Turns
  on Files → Stock Library + the builder's "Stock photos" picker tab.
- ✅ **Migration `0106`** — Eric applied it. Security Advisor errors closed. (44 warnings
  + 84 suggestions remain — lower priority, mostly function search_path / advisory.)
- ✅ **`git push`** — Eric pushed; the builder/studio frontend is live.
- ✅ **Visual Studio (AI-generated images)** — DONE 2026-07-14. `VISUAL_MODEL_KEY` (an
  OpenAI key, `sk-proj-…`) set on prod + redeployed. Defaults to OpenAI images
  (`gpt-image-1`); if that model needs org verification, switch `VISUAL_MODEL_NAME` to
  `dall-e-3`. All owner keys now in.
- ❓ **Messages** — Eric says he specified what he wants; it did not survive compaction.
  Messaging was audited + polished earlier (`messaging-ux-polish` merged) and the inbox
  groups client messages by client. **Need one line: what's actually wrong/missing now?**

## Code — for me to do (Eric will batch-review)

- ✅ **Analytics / Google Search Console connection** — DONE. Reworded the agency card to
  operator framing ("connect it for them — it's your setup, not theirs") and made it a
  working action: links straight to that client's scoped connections
  (`/connections.html?client=<siteId>`) when one client needs it. Deployed.
- ✅ **AEM component parity — Table, Title, Link List, Spotlight** — DONE. All four built
  (backend + builder editor) and deployed; drop them from "Add section". (Existing set
  already had carousel/image/text/accordion/buttons/columns/etc.)
- ✅ **Convert flow** — VERIFIED, no bug. All 3 convert options already land the customer
  in the client portal (`client.html`); the CRM only keeps *your* operator view.
- ✅ **"Add a section shows nothing"** — root-caused + fixed: added blocks are now seeded
  with editable placeholder content so a content section renders the instant you add it;
  media blocks open their editor to pick a file. Deployed + in presence.html (push).
- ✅ **#184 Drop a component into a column** — DONE. A column cell can now hold any
  component (text OR media: video, image, gallery, feature list, stats, table, …) via an
  "Or drop a component here" picker per column, each with a mini-editor. Backend +
  editor, deployed. (1-column was already supported.) Containers can't nest (no infinite
  recursion). NOTE: media already worked standalone (Image/Video/Gallery/Carousel
  components + per-cell image) — this just adds nesting.
- ⏳ **More visual templates/themes** (#183) — only 3 template *designs* exist
  (business-classic, editorial, restaurant-classic). Starter *layouts* are at 13, but
  Eric also wants more full theme designs. The one substantial builder item left.

## Done this stretch (verify after push)

- ✅ Builder: real drag-and-drop, "+ Add one section" actually adds, repeat any section,
  remove any built-in section incl. the hero, blank canvas + delete template/page.
- ✅ Editable GLOBAL menu (nav) with dropdowns + page links (migration `0105` applied,
  backend deployed).
- ✅ 13 starter layouts, generic ones at top.
- ✅ Visual Studio added to the builder left rail.
- ✅ Sidebar folded into Design (Today · Design · Photos · Visual Studio · Bookings ·
  Reviews · History).
- ✅ `/studio` no longer silently bounces a no-workspace account to the client portal —
  honest panel + explicit portal link. (Cause of Eric's bounce: signed into /studio with
  a personal/owner-less account; sign in with the **dds owner** account.)
- ✅ AI writing helper in text components; image component uses uploaded photos.
